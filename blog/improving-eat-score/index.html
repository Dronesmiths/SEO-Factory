        <h1>How to Improve Your E-A-T Score</h1>
        <p>Improving your E-A-T score is a long-term investment in your website's authority and user trust. Here are the
            key steps to take.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 1: Audit Your Authors</h2>
            <p>Verify that every piece of content on your site has a clearly identified author with a bio that
                highlights their relevant experience and expertise.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Step 2: Citations and References</h2>
            <p>Back up your claims with citations from high-authority sources. This demonstrates that your content is
                thoroughly researched and authoritative.</p>

                    <h3>Is there a numerical E-A-T score?</h3>
                    <p>No, Google does not assign a single numerical E-A-T score to websites. It's a qualitative
                        assessment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does it take to improve E-A-T?</h3>
                    <p>It can take several months to see the effects of E-A-T improvements as search engines re-evaluate
                        your site's reputation.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do external links help E-A-T?</h3>
                    <p>Linking out to authoritative sources can help demonstrate transparency, but it's the quality of
                        your own content that matters most.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I remove low-quality content?</h3>
                    <p>Pruning thin or outdated content can significantly improve the overall E-A-T signals of your
                        domain.</p>

                    <h3>What is the role of citations?</h3>
                    <p>Citations provide evidence that your information is accurate and supported by established facts
                        or expertise.</p>
